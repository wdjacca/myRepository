<ln><noun type="tree">Trees</noun> and <noun type="stones">stones</noun> have long been objects of deep devotion in <loc name="jp">Japan</loc>. Originally there were no <noun type="shrine">shrine</noun> buildings; instead a <noun type="tree">tree</noun>, <noun type="forest">forest</noun>, or a large boulder or a <noun type="mountain">mountain</noun>, festooned with ropes, would be the focus of worship.
</ln>
<ln>In <loc name="jp">Japan</loc> the mysterious forces of nature, called <lang type="jp">ke</lang>, were believed to permeate palpable matter and formless space (collectively called <lang type="jp">mono</lang> in Japanese) to create <noun type="mononoke">mononoke</noun>. <noun type="mononoke">Mononoke</noun> was seen to coalesce in <noun type="tree">trees</noun> and <noun type="stones">stones</noun>. Certain <noun type="tree">trees</noun>, especially the cryptomeria and the evergreen <lang type="jp">sakaki</lang>, were considered sacred for this reason. When one of these <noun type="tree">trees</noun> was felled and the wood used in the construction of a <noun type="shrine">shrine</noun>, this sacred quality was believed to follow it into the building. The sacred <noun type="tree">tree</noun> itself was literally and symbolically present in the form of a pillar or post around which the <noun type="shrine">shrine</noun> was constructed.
</ln>
<ln>The great <shrine name="shinto">Shinto shrine</shrine> at <shrine name="ise">Ise</shrine>).
</ln>
<ln>The <noun type="shrine">shrine</noun> consists of two groups of buildings: the <noun type="imperial">Imperial Shrine</noun> (<lang type="jp">Kotai Jingu</lang>), also known as the <lang type="jp">Naiku</lang> (inner <noun type="shrine">shrine</noun>), and the <shrine name="toyouke">Toyouke Shrine</shrine> (<lang type="jp">Toyouke Daijingu</lang> ) which constitutes the <lang type="jp">Geku</lang> or outer <noun type="shrine">shrine</noun>. The <lang type="jp">Naiku</lang> is dedicated to the <person name="sun-goddess">Sun Goddess <lang type="jp">Amaterasu Omikami</lang></person> (<lang type="eng-translate">Heaven-Illuminating Great Deity</lang>), and the <lang type="jp">Geku</lang> to the <person name="cereals-goddess">Goddess of Cereals <lang type="jp">Toyouke Omikami</lang></person> (<lang type="eng-translate">Abundant Food Great Deity</lang>). Each <noun type="shrine">shrine</noun> is composed of a number of buildings, including ancillary <noun type="shrine">shrines</noun>, workshops, storehouses, etc. Each <noun type="shrine">shrine</noun> has an inner precinct with a main sanctuary and two attendant <noun type="shrine">shrines</noun>, as well as treasuries, fences, and gates.
</ln>
<ln>Both <noun type="shrine">shrine</noun>s are constructed of wood, and every twenty years both are totally rebuilt on an adjoining site. The empty site of the previous <noun type="shrine">shrine</noun> (called the <lang type="jp">kodenchi</lang>) is strewn with large white pebbles. The only building on the empty site, which retains its sacredness for the intervening twenty years, is a small wooden shed or hut (oi-ya) inside of which is a post about seven feet high known as <lang type="jp">shin-no-mihashira</lang> (literally <lang type="eng-translate">the august column of the heart</lang>, or more freely translated as <lang type="eng-translate">sacred central post</lang>). The new <noun type="shrine">shrine</noun> will be erected over and around this post which are the holiest and most mysterious objects in the <shrine name="ise">Ise Shrine</shrine>. They remain hidden at all times.

</ln><ln><person name="tange">Kenzo Tange</person> and <person type="kawazoe">Noboru Kawazoe</person> (<bibref><pg num="167">p. 167</pg>, see Bibliography below</bibref>) suggest that:
</ln>
<ln>the erection of a single post in the center of a sacred area strewn with <noun type="stones">stones</noun> represents the form taken by <loc name="jp">Japanese</loc> places of worship in very ancient times; the <lang type="jp">shin-no-mihashira</lang> would thus be the survival of a symbolism from a very pimitive symbolism to the present day.
</ln><ln>The present buildings reproduce the temple first ceremoniously rebuilt in <time>92 CE</time> by <person name="jito">Empress Jito</person>. The first temple had been built by her husband <person name="temmu">Emperor Temmu</person> (678-686), the first <lang type="jp">Mikado</lang> to rule over a united <loc name="jp">Japan</loc>.
</ln>
<ln><person name="temmu">Emperor Temmu</person> had established <shrine name="ise">Ise</shrine> as the principal sacred plant of <shrine name="shinto">Shinto</shrine>, however, is the <lang type="jp">sakaki</lang> (a shrub related to the tea bush). The <lang type="jp">shin-no-mihashira</lang> is taken to represent a branch of the <lang type="jp">sakaki</lang> stuck upright in the ground.
</ln>
<ln>The chambers of the <noun type="shrine">shrines</noun> are raised on timber piles which themselves are analogous to the central sacred post. The roof is not supported by the walls (although the rafters do rest on purlins), but the ridge beam is carried instead by two large columns at either end which embedded directly into the ground without any foundation.
</ln>
<ln>Besides <noun type="tree">trees</noun>, at the <shrine name="ise">Ise Shrine</shrine> are many subsidiary shrines of rocks from the sea which are regarded as the abodes (<lang type="jp">iwakura</lang> or <lang type="eng-translate">rock abodes</lang>) of deities.
