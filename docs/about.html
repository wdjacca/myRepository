    <p>Hello again! Here's a little more about me!</p>
    <p class="review"> I grew up and studied in Hong Kong for 15 years (kindergarten to highschool). After highschool, I came to the US to complete my Bachelor's Degree of Arts at Pennsylvania State University Erie, The Behrend College, majoring in Digital Media, Arts and Technology, alongside 4 minors (Data Visualization, Media Producion, Management Information System, and Transnational Perspective) and a German certificate. I am also a Schreyer's Honors Scholar and completed my honor's thesis titled "Sherlock Holmes of the British Radiowaves: A Digital Remediation Project", which could be accessed on the "Projects" tab on this portfolio website.</p>
    <p class="review">Aside from academics, I was part of Theta Phi Alpha fraternity and served on the executive board for both the fraternity as well as the Panhellenic Council that the fraternity was a part of. Having grown up in Hong Kong, I am fluent in three languages (Cantonese, Mandarin, English). I also have a basic understanding of German, as well as Japanese and Korean. Learning languages is part of my passion and I hope to be able to put it into use some day in my career.</p>
	<p class="review"> I am passionate about all things coding, data and programming. While I primarily worked with html and xml during my college years, I enjoy learning about other programming languages such as Python. I have taken several classes in my college years for Python and Javascript, although I wouldn't consider them my main programming lanugage. I enjoy the structural portions of programming while also the creative outlets that html and xml allow me to explore. </p>
	<p class="review"> Personally, I would consider myself a quick learner. I enjoy learning new things and tackling problems through trial and error, which is something that coding and programming definitely provided me, although sometimes there would be some obstacles that were more challenging to overcome. I may be introverted at times but I work well with others and will always be willing to help out whenever possible.</p>
