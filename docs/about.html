    <p>Hello again! Here's a little more about me!</p>
    <p class="review"> I studied in Hong Kong for 15 years (kindergarten to highschool) and recently came to Penn State Behrend to work towards a DIGIT major, alongside 4 minors (Data Visualization, Media Producion, Management Information System, and Transnational Perspective) and a German certificate. </p>
    <p class="review">I am fluent in three languages (Cantonese, Mandarin, English) and understand 4 others. I have a passion in learning langauges and hope to be able to work for the United Nations or any international organization as a translator one day.</p>
    
    <p class="review"> My friends generally describe me as a hardworking and detail-orientated person, being fairly artistic and enjoys keeping a bullet journal to keep track of my daily tasks and schedules. </p>
