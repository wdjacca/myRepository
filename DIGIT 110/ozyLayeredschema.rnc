# No sign means there is only one and exactly one 
# The "+" means at least one or more
# The "?" means zero or one
# THe "*" means zero or more. This is the most flexible repetition indicator

# lines are special: they contain MIXED CONTENT
# Mixed content literally means text is flowing freely around elements. The elements can appear anywhere.

# We want to use a datatype. Can be found in tutorial.
