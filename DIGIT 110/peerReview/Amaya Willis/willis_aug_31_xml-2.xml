<line type="greeting">My Dear Friend</line>

<para>I recieved your kind and welcome <emphasis>*letter*</emphasis> and should have replied to it much earlier but various
hindrances have prevented me and when I would have written I was in Bed with a severe
attack of <disease>Rheumatism</disease> so that I could not raise my hands to my head I am still suffering with it
in my shoulders. and we have had much sickness in the family this <season>winter</season> I know my plea for
want of time will find its way to your heart</para>

<para>my dear friend let me thank you for your kind and generous offer of the hospitality of your
pleasant home which would afford me much pleasure to accept but as yet I . . .
<missing>[obliterated]</missing> not <emphasis>*cannot*</emphasis> decide my friends <name amount="2">Mr &amp; Mrs Brockett</name> is very anxious that I should go to their home and write they live very quietly and retired they were here and spent a day and
night with me and saw from my daily duties that it was hard for me to find much time to write as
yet I have not written a single page by daylight <name>Mrs W</name> dont know from my lips that I am writing
for a Book and has never seen a line of what I have written I told her in the <season>Autumn</season> that I
would give her <name><!--I can't tell for sure if this is a person since it is worded weird-->Louisa</name> services through the <season>winter</season> if she would allow me my <season>winter</season> evenings to
myself but with the care of the little baby and the big Babies and at the houshold calls I have
but a little time to think or write but I have tried in my poor way to do my best and that is not
much<!--I'm having trouble understanding what the writer is talking about, the words don't seem to make sense--></para>

<para>And you my dear friend must not expect much where there has been so little given Yes dear
<name>Amy</name> there has been more than a bountiful share of suffering given enough to crush the finer
feelings of stouter hearts than this poor timid one of mine but I will try and not send you a
portriature of feelings just now the poor Book is in its Chrysalis state and though I can never
make it a butterfly I am satisfied to have it creep meekly among some of the humbler bugs I
sometimes wish that I could fall into a <story>Rip Van Winkle</story> sleep and awake with the blest belief of 
that little <item type="doll"><!--I looked this up and the only thing I could find was a topsy turvy doll--> Witch Topsy</item> that I never was born but you will say it is too late in the day I have
outgrown the belief oh yes and outlived it too but you know that my bump of hope is large how
is my dear old friend <name>Mr Post</name> I have no doubt but that he is at his Post perhaps heading a
mighty Phalanx to put the <location type="state">Nebraska</location> bill through well he shall have my vote <date when="1856">1856</date> when <name type="author">Arnold</name>
and <name type="king">Belshazzar</name> rools down the avalanche remember me with much kindness to all the family
tell <name>Willie</name> I want to see him very much when you write tell me if I know the friend that you
spoke of in your letter as soon as my plans are more matured I will write you again it will be
very difficult for to get some one in my place yet it will be left for me to do I know of but one
person she is a <profession>Ladys nurse</profession> and her wages would be high but I think that can get her she is a
nice person I must stop this rambling letter let no one see it <name>Lou</name> sends much love to you I am
sorry you dont know her better you would love her<!--there is hardly any punctuation in this document and the sentences don't really make sense, I did the best I could to find things to code--></para>
