            <sent>... I hope you will call &amp; see, if she is now in the city, one of the most
                interesting cases of escape from slavery that you have ever seen.</sent>
            <sent>She was sent from this city yesterday morning &amp;' consigned to Mr.
                Johnston.</sent>
            <sent>She is from N.C. was brought away by a sea captain. She was sold by her master to
                the speculators &amp; to avoid being sent away she was hidden for 7 years! in a
                small upper room of a house occupied by colored people &amp; within a hundred yards
                of her master's house, who did not know she was there.</sent>
            <sent>She had not seen her boy, for 7 years till within 3 days of her coming
                away.</sent>
            <sent>She has been shut up so long that she can hardly walk. Another woman was brought
                away from Delaware, who was found tied to a tree.</sent>
            <sent>If Mr. Johnston was the man he ought to be, he would invite you occasionally to
                see some of these remarkable cases, which are continually passing from Phil. to
                N.Y.</sent>
            <sent><word type="strikeout">The Vagrant</word> what a queer mistake. The Vigilance
                Committee of this city are doing a fine business in weakening &amp; delapidating the
                edifice of slavery.</sent>
            <sent>Success to them...</sent>
