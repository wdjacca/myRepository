               <li>Royal Academy of Arts<br />The private arts institution The Royal Academy of Arts was
                  founded by George III on 10 December 1768, at the behest of architect
                  Sir William Chambers. Chambers and other artists and
                  architects sought to establish a British national "society for promoting the
                  Arts of Design," a society that would sponsor an annual exhibition (later the
                  Summer Exhibition) as well as a School of Design (later the Royal Academy
                  Schools.) Thirty-four founding members were elected; today, the society elects
                  no more than 80 members at one time as Royal Academicians (Members of the Royal
                  Academy, RA). During Mitford’s time, the Royal Academy was housed at Somerset House, a building designed and
                  built by Chambers beginning in 1776 and likely not
                  completed until after 1819. The institution moved
                  to Trafalgar Square in the 1830s, to share space with the newly-founded National
                  Gallery, and remained there until 1867.
                  Mitford’s friend and correspondent Benjamin Robert
                  Haydon, was a Member of the Royal Academy.

                  father’s will, a case taken on by Talfourd, and which was settled before it
                  got to a jury.

                  James II’s right to the throne of
                  England, even though he was Catholic. The term connoted "Irish Catholic
                  outlaw." The term was adopted by the party, which became generally
                  affiliated with the interests of the country gentry, Anglicanism, and
                  support of the divine right of kings. The party was loosely affiliated until
                  the late 18th century, when William Pitt the Younger
                  emerged as the leader of a revitalized party. The Conservative Party,
                  founded in 1834 by Sir Robert Peel,
                  absorbed and organized the Tory Party and retained the party nickname.
