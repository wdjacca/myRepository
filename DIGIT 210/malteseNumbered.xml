    <sp n="4"><speaker>SPADE</speaker>
        <stage>NARRATES</stage> My name is Spade, Sam Spade. License number three-five-
        seven-eight-nine-six, issued by the police department of San Francisco. Occupation: private
        detective -- sometimes known as "private eye." My files in the case of the Maltese Falcon
        are closed, but I've got the Maltese Falcon. I got it and some dough. My partner got
        murdered and a very slick chick went up for life. I'll tell you about it.</sp>
    <stage type="scene" n="5">MUSIC ... AN ACCENT ... THEN IN BG</stage>
    <sp n="5"><speaker>SPADE</speaker>
        <stage>NARRATES</stage> This slick dame comes to see me one day, gives me a song- and-dance
        about her sister and a guy called Floyd Thursby. She wants us to get her sister back before
        her mother and father get in from Hawaii. I put my partner, Miles Archer, on the case. That
        night, he gets murdered. And so does this guy Thursby.</sp>
    <stage type="scene" n="6">SOUND: FOOTSTEPS</stage>
    <sp n="6"><speaker>SPADE</speaker>
        <stage>NARRATES</stage> I go round to the apartment where the dame is living, the one called
        Brigid O'Shaughnessy. <stage>CHUCKLES</stage> She had something I seemed to go for.</sp>
    <stage type="scene" n="7">MUSIC ... OUT</stage>
    <sp n="7"><speaker>BRIGID</speaker>
        <stage>SURPRISED TO SEE HIM</stage> Oh, uh, Mr. Spade. Come in.</sp>
    <sp n="8"><speaker>SPADE</speaker> I have come in.</sp>
    <sp n="9"><speaker>BRIGID</speaker>
        <stage>CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY</stage> Oh, yes. So you have. <stage>TROUBLED</stage> Mr. Spade,
        tell me -- am I to blame for last night?</sp>
    <sp n="10"><speaker>SPADE</speaker> You warned us that Thursby was dangerous. Of course, you
        lied to us about your sister and all that, but that doesn't count. We didn't believe
        you.</sp>
    <sp n="11"><speaker>BRIGID</speaker> Ohh. Help me, Mr. Spade. I - I need help so badly. I've no
        right to ask you but I do ask you. Help me.</sp>
    <sp n="12"><speaker>SPADE</speaker>
        <stage>CHUCKLES</stage> You won't need much of anybody's help. You're good. You're awful
        good. It's chiefly your eyes, I think, and that throb you get into your voice when you say
        things like - <stage>MIMICS HER</stage> "Help me, Mr. Spade."</sp>
    <sp n="13"><speaker>BRIGID</speaker> I deserve that. But, oh, the lie was in the WAY I said it
        and - not at all in what I said. </sp>
    <sp n="14"><speaker>SPADE</speaker> If I'm going to help you, I've got to have some sort of a
        line on your Floyd Thursby.</sp>
    <sp n="15"><speaker>BRIGID</speaker> I met him in the Orient. We came here from Hong Kong last
        week.</sp>
    <sp n="16"><speaker>SPADE</speaker> Did he kill Archer?</sp>
    <sp n="17"><speaker>BRIGID</speaker> Yes, certainly.</sp>
    <sp n="18"><speaker>SPADE</speaker> Picked a nice sort of playmate.</sp>
    <sp n="19"><speaker>BRIGID</speaker> Only that sort could have helped me if - if he had been
        loyal.</sp>
    <sp n="20"><speaker>SPADE</speaker> How bad a hole are you actually in?</sp>
    <sp n="21"><speaker>BRIGID</speaker> As bad as could be.</sp>
    <sp n="22"><speaker>SPADE</speaker> Physical danger?</sp>
    <sp n="23"><speaker>BRIGID</speaker> I'm not heroic. I don't think there's anything worse than
        death.</sp>
    <sp n="24"><speaker>SPADE</speaker> Then it's that?</sp>
    <sp n="25"><speaker>BRIGID</speaker> It's that as surely as we're sitting here. Unless you help
        me.</sp>
    <sp n="26"><speaker>SPADE</speaker> Who killed Thursby? Your enemies or his?</sp>
    <sp n="27"><speaker>BRIGID</speaker> I don't know. His, I suppose. I'm afraid, I don't
        know.</sp>
    <sp n="28"><speaker>SPADE</speaker> Who ARE these enemies?</sp>
    <sp n="29"><speaker>BRIGID</speaker>
        <stage>EVASIVE</stage> Well, there's a small, dark man with white teeth and a smooth,
        dangerous fat man.</sp>
    <sp n="30"><speaker>SPADE</speaker> Oh, this is hopeless. Well, how much money have you
        got?</sp>
    <sp n="31"><speaker>BRIGID</speaker> I've about five hundred dollars left.</sp>
    <sp n="32"><speaker>SPADE</speaker> Give it to me.</sp>

        <stage>DEFENSIVE</stage> I had to keep some to live on.</sp>
    <sp n="35"><speaker>SPADE</speaker>

        with me. I can let myself out.</sp>
    <stage type="scene" n="9">MUSIC ... A BRIDGE, THEN IN BG</stage>
    <sp n="36"><speaker>SPADE</speaker>
        <stage>NARRATES</stage> I went by the office then and found a dark little guy with very
        white teeth waiting for me. His name was Joel Cairo. He was a Greek.</sp>
    <stage type="scene" n="10">MUSIC ... OUT</stage>
    <stage type="scene" n="11">SOUND: DOOR SHUTS</stage>
    <sp n="37"><speaker>CAIRO</speaker>
        <stage>MOUSY, WITH AN ALLEGEDLY GREEK ACCENT</stage> Mr. Spade, I'm trying to recover an -
        an ornament that has been, shall we say, mislaid. I thought and hoped you could assist me. </sp>
    <sp n="38"><speaker>SPADE</speaker> Uh huh.</sp>
    <sp n="39"><speaker>CAIRO</speaker> The ornament is a statuette, the black figure of a bird. I
        am prepared to pay the sum of five thousand dollars for its recovery -- and no questions
        asked.</sp>
    <sp n="40"><speaker>SPADE</speaker> Five thousand's a lot of money. It's a very interesting
        figure--</sp>
    <sp n="41"><speaker>CAIRO</speaker> You will put your hands together, back of your neck, Mr.
        Spade. </sp>
    <sp n="42"><speaker>SPADE</speaker> Huh? Oh, sure.</sp>
    <sp n="43"><speaker>CAIRO</speaker> I shall shoot you if you try to stop me, Mr. Spade. But I
        must search your office.</sp>
    <sp n="44"><speaker>SPADE</speaker> You won't find anything but a pair of worn out rubbers, a
        half-pint of rum and a pack o' chewing gum.</sp>
    <sp n="45"><speaker>CAIRO</speaker> We shall see. Please stand up.</sp>

    <sp n="51"><speaker>CAIRO</speaker>
        <stage>WEAKLY</stage> I am very slow at things like that, unfortunately.</sp>
    <sp n="52"><speaker>SPADE</speaker>
        <stage>AMUSED</stage> Yeah.</sp>
    <sp n="53"><speaker>CAIRO</speaker> I'm still prepared to pay five thousand dollars for the
        return of the figure. Do you have it, Mr. Spade?</sp>
    <sp n="54"><speaker>SPADE</speaker> No.</sp>
    <sp n="55"><speaker>CAIRO</speaker>
        <stage>CONFUSED</stage> If it is not here, why did you just risk serious injury to prevent
        my searching for it?</sp>
    <sp n="56"><speaker>SPADE</speaker> Well, I should sit around and let people come in and stick
        me up?</sp>
    <sp n="57"><speaker>CAIRO</speaker> You wish some assurance of my sincerity? A retainer?</sp>
    <sp n="58"><speaker>SPADE</speaker> I might.</sp>
    <sp n="59"><speaker>CAIRO</speaker> Say, one hundred dollars?</sp>
    <stage type="scene" n="15">SOUND: WHIPS OUT SOME CASH</stage>

    <stage type="scene" n="16">SOUND: MONEY CHANGES HANDS</stage>
    <sp n="61"><speaker>SPADE</speaker> Thanks. Your first guess was that I had the bird. What's
        your second guess?</sp>
    <sp n="62"><speaker>CAIRO</speaker> That you know where it is, or where you can get it.</sp>
    <sp n="63"><speaker>SPADE</speaker> You're not hiring me to murder or do burglary but to get
        back the figure in some lawful way? Say, from a dame with red hair? Or a smooth, dangerous
        fat man?</sp>
    <sp n="64"><speaker>CAIRO</speaker> Oh, so you know? You must beware of them. They would stop at
        nothing. May - may I have my pistol now?</sp>
    <sp n="65"><speaker>SPADE</speaker>
        <stage>CHUCKLES</stage> Yeah, yeah, sure. I'd forgotten it.</sp>
    <sp n="66"><speaker>CAIRO</speaker> Thank you. Now, Mr. Spade, you will kindly clasp your hands
        behind your neck? </sp>
    <sp n="67"><speaker>SPADE</speaker> What the--? <stage>STARTS TO LAUGH</stage></sp>
    <sp n="68"><speaker>CAIRO</speaker> Don't move, Mr. Spade. This time, I might shoot. I insist on

    <stage type="scene" n="17">MUSIC ... A BRIEF BRIDGE ... THEN IN BG</stage>
    <sp n="70"><speaker>SPADE</speaker>
        <stage>NARRATES</stage> I finally got rid of the Greek and started back for Brigid
        O'Shaughnessy's apartment. Matter of fact, I had a hunch that the Greek was going there
        himself and started to tail his cab when a sad-faced guy poked something into my back and
        said:</sp>
    <stage type="scene" n="18">MUSIC ... AN ACCENT ... THEN OUT</stage>
    <sp n="71"><speaker>WILMER</speaker> Come on. The Fat Man wants yo see ya.</sp>
    <stage type="scene" n="19">MUSIC ... AN ACCENT, A BRIEF BRIDGE ... THEN IN OUT</stage>
    <sp n="72"><speaker>WILMER</speaker> Here he is, Mr. Gutman -- the guy who was talkin' to the
        dame and the Greek.</sp>
    <sp n="73"><speaker>GUTMAN</speaker>
        <stage>ENGLISH ACCENT</stage> Ah! Mr. Spade!</sp>
    <sp n="74"><speaker>SPADE</speaker>
        <stage>PLEASANTLY</stage> Mr. Gutman.</sp>
    <sp n="75"><speaker>GUTMAN</speaker> We begin well, sir. I distrust a man who talks too
        much.</sp>
    <sp n="76"><speaker>SPADE</speaker> I like to talk.</sp>
    <sp n="77"><speaker>GUTMAN</speaker> Of course, talking's something you can't do judiciously -
        unless you keep in practice. </sp>
    <sp n="78"><speaker>SPADE</speaker> Yeah.</sp>
    <sp n="79"><speaker>GUTMAN</speaker> Now, sir, we'll talk if you like. And I'll tell you right
        out that I'm a man [who] likes talking to a man who likes to talk.</sp>
    <sp n="80"><speaker>SPADE</speaker> Swell. Will we talk about the black bird?</sp>
    <sp n="81"><speaker>GUTMAN</speaker> You're the man for me, sir. No beating about the bush,
        right to the point. Let us talk about the black bird, by all means. Mr. Spade, have you any
        conception of how much money can be got for that black bird?</sp>
    <sp n="82"><speaker>SPADE</speaker> No.</sp>
    <sp n="83"><speaker>GUTMAN</speaker> Well, sir, if I told you -- if I told you half, you'd call
        me a liar.</sp>
    <sp n="84"><speaker>SPADE</speaker>
        <stage>WITH A CHUCKLE</stage> No, no. Not even if I thought so. But you just tell me what it
        is and I'll figure out the profits.</sp>
    <sp n="85"><speaker>GUTMAN</speaker> You mean you don't know what that bird is?</sp>
    <sp n="86"><speaker>SPADE</speaker> Well, I know what it's supposed to look like. I know the
        value in human life you people put on it.</sp>
    <sp n="87"><speaker>GUTMAN</speaker> Miss O'Shaughnessy didn't tell you what it is? And Cairo
        didn't, either?</sp>
    <sp n="88"><speaker>SPADE</speaker> He offered me ten thousand for it.</sp>
    <sp n="89"><speaker>GUTMAN</speaker>
        <stage>SCOFFS</stage> Ten thousand! <stage>CHUCKLES</stage> And dollars, mind you, not even
        pounds. <stage>SERIOUS</stage> They must know what it is. Or do they? What is your
        impression?</sp>
    <sp n="90"><speaker>SPADE</speaker> I can't tell. They're both lying.</sp>
    <sp n="91"><speaker>GUTMAN</speaker> If they don't know, I'm the only one in the whole wide,
        sweet world who does.</sp>
    <sp n="92"><speaker>SPADE</speaker> Swell. When you've told me, that'll make two of us.</sp>
    <sp n="93"><speaker>GUTMAN</speaker> Mathematically correct, sir. But I don't know for certain
        that I'm going to tell you.</sp>
    <sp n="94"><speaker>SPADE</speaker> Oh, don't be foolish. You know what it is and I know where
        it is. That's why I'm here.</sp>
    <sp n="95"><speaker>GUTMAN</speaker> Well, sir, where is it? </sp>
    <sp n="96"><speaker>SPADE</speaker>
        <stage>CHUCKLES</stage> Don't be silly.</sp>
    <sp n="97"><speaker>GUTMAN</speaker> You see, I must tell you what I know but you will not tell
        me what you know. That is hardly equitable, sir. No, no. I don't think we can do business
        along those lines. </sp>
    <sp n="98"><speaker>SPADE</speaker>
        <stage>SUDDENLY VIOLENTLY ANGRY</stage> Yeah? Well, think again and think fast. I can get
        along without you! And keep that gunsel away from me while you're makin' up your mind! I'll
        kill him! GUTMAN: Well, sir, I must say you have a most violent temper.</sp>
    <sp n="99"><speaker>SPADE</speaker> Well, what are you wasting time for?! You've got till 5:30,
        then you're either in or out for keeps!</sp>
    <stage type="scene" n="20">MUSIC ... A BRIDGE ... THEN IN BG</stage>
    <sp n="100"><speaker>SPADE</speaker>
        <stage>NARRATES</stage> Three characters and a black bird. Well, all I knew was, my partner
        was dead and the cops were getting very uncooperative about the whole thing, including "who
        killed Floyd Thursby?" I thought I'd better get back to see that O'Shaughnessy dame before
        it was too late. And, sure enough, it almost was.</sp>
    <sp n="101"><speaker>BRIGID</speaker> They came here and took him away.</sp>
    <sp n="102"><speaker>SPADE</speaker> Took who away? Who?</sp>
    <sp n="103"><speaker>BRIGID</speaker> The police. They - they wanted to talk to you, too. They
        took Mr. Cairo with them.</sp>
    <sp n="104"><speaker>SPADE</speaker> What was HE doing here?</sp>
    <sp n="105"><speaker>BRIGID</speaker>
        <stage>EVASIVE</stage> He came to talk about the bird.</sp>
    <sp n="106"><speaker>SPADE</speaker> Hey, what IS this bird, this falcon, that everybody's all
        steamed up about?</sp>
    <sp n="107"><speaker>BRIGID</speaker> Suppose I wouldn't tell you anything at all about it? What
        would you do? Something wild and unpredictable?</sp>
    <sp n="108"><speaker>SPADE</speaker> Maybe.</sp>
    <sp n="109"><speaker>BRIGID</speaker> Well, it's a black figure, as you know -- smooth and
        shiny, of a bird -- a hawk or falcon, about twelve inches high.</sp>
    <sp n="110"><speaker>SPADE</speaker> Well, what makes it so important?</sp>
    <sp n="111"><speaker>BRIGID</speaker> I don't know. They wouldn't tell me. But they promised me
        five hundred pounds if I helped them get it from the man who had it.</sp>
    <sp n="112"><speaker>SPADE</speaker> Go ahead.</sp>
    <sp n="113"><speaker>BRIGID</speaker> They promised me five hundred pounds to help them and I
        did. Then we found that Joel Cairo was going to take the falcon and desert Floyd and me, so
        we - did that to Joel first.</sp>
    <sp n="114"><speaker>SPADE</speaker> You ARE a liar.</sp>
    <sp n="115"><speaker>BRIGID</speaker>
        <stage>AFTER A BEAT, AGREES</stage> I am a liar. I've always been a liar.</sp>
    <sp n="116"><speaker>SPADE</speaker>
        <stage>CHUCKLES</stage> Well, don't brag about it. Is there any truth at all in that
        yarn?</sp>
    <sp n="117"><speaker>BRIGID</speaker> Some. Not very much.</sp>
    <sp n="118"><speaker>SPADE</speaker> Well, we've got plenty of time. I'll put some coffee on and
        we'll try again.</sp>
    <sp n="119"><speaker>BRIGID</speaker>
        <stage>SIGHS</stage> Oh, I'm so tired. So tired of lying and thinking up lies, and - not
        knowing what is a lie and what is the truth. Oh, darling, don't stare at me like that. Come

    <sp n="135"><speaker>GUTMAN</speaker> Very good. In 1539, these crusading knights persuaded
        Emperor Charles V to give them the island of Malta. He made but one condition. They were to
        pay him each year the tribute of a falcon - in acknowledgment that Malta was still under
        Spain. Do you follow me?</sp>
    <sp n="136"><speaker>SPADE</speaker> Yeah. </sp>
    <sp n="137"><speaker>GUTMAN</speaker> Have you any conception of the extreme, immeasurable
        wealth of the Order of that time?</sp>
    <sp n="138"><speaker>SPADE</speaker> Well, I imagine they were pretty well fixed.</sp>
    <sp n="139"><speaker>GUTMAN</speaker> They were rolling in wealth, sir. They hit upon the happy
        thought of sending the emperor for the first year's tribute, not an insignificant live bird,
        but a glorious golden falcon, encrusted from head to foot with the finest jewels in their
        coffers. </sp>

    <sp n="141"><speaker>GUTMAN</speaker> Well, what do you think of these knights?</sp>
    <sp n="142"><speaker>SPADE</speaker> I don't know.</sp>
    <sp n="143"><speaker>GUTMAN</speaker> Well, sir, the glorious falcon never reached Spain.
        Buccaneers raided the galleon. In 1713, the bird showed up in Sicily. In 1840, in Paris. And
        it had by that time, acquired a coat of black enamel, looking like nothing but a fairly
        interesting black statue. In 1923, a Greek dealer found it in an obscure Paris shop. He knew
        what it was. I heard about it in London and rushed over to buy it. But the Greek was
        murdered and the falcon gone. That was twenty-three years ago. For twenty-three years, I've
        searched for the bird. I traced it to the home of a Russian general, Kemidov, but he
        wouldn't sell, even though he knew nothing of its value. I was forced to send my agents
        after it. They got it, sir. But I haven't got it. But I'm going to get it, sir. Um, how soon
        can you, uh, how soon are you willing to produce the falcon?</sp>
    <sp n="144"><speaker>SPADE</speaker>
        <stage>INCREASINGLY GROGGY</stage> Uh, couple of days.</sp>
    <sp n="145"><speaker>GUTMAN</speaker> That is satisfactory. Well, sir, here's a fair bargain and
        profits large enough for both of us.</sp>
    <sp n="146"><speaker>SPADE</speaker> What's your idea of a fair bargain?</sp>
    <sp n="147"><speaker>GUTMAN</speaker> Shall I say one hundred thousand?</sp>
    <sp n="148"><speaker>SPADE</speaker> Why not?</sp>
    <sp n="149"><speaker>GUTMAN</speaker> What do you say to a quarter of a million?</sp>

    <sp n="151"><speaker>GUTMAN</speaker> Why not?</sp>

        rode to the docks. The La Paloma was on fire and burning beautifully. I went back to my

    <sp n="185"><speaker>GUTMAN</speaker> Yes, sir, we were. But this is genuine coin of the realm,

    <sp n="186"><speaker>SPADE</speaker> Well, that may be. But I'VE got the falcon.</sp>
    <sp n="187"><speaker>CAIRO</speaker> I should not think it would be necessary to remind you, Mr.

    <sp n="188"><speaker>SPADE</speaker> Yes, I'm trying not to let that worry me. We'll come to the
        money later. There's another thing to be taken care of first. We've got to have a "fall

    <sp n="189"><speaker>CAIRO</speaker> Two. Only two murders, Mr. Spade. Thursby undoubtedly

        Thursby?</sp>
    <sp n="207"><speaker>GUTMAN</speaker> Thursby was Miss O'Shaughnessy's ally. We thought, in
        disposing of him, we would teach Miss O'Shaughnessy to patch up her differences with us
        regarding the falcon.</sp>
    <sp n="208"><speaker>SPADE</speaker> And the mate from the La Paloma?</sp>
    <sp n="209"><speaker>GUTMAN</speaker> That was Miss O'Shaughnessy's fault.</sp>

    </sp>
    <sp n="211"><speaker>GUTMAN</speaker> Cairo got in touch with me when he saw the notice of the

        Kong. He called on this man but he, with Miss O'Shaughnessy and the bird, slipped through
        our fingers. We followed them to her apartment and Wilmer shot the mate as he was coming
        down the fire escape. He shot him many times but the man was tough and he did not drop the
        falcon. We, um, persuaded Miss O'Shaughnessy to call your office. But, unfortunately, she
        did not call in time to prevent you from meeting the mate and getting the falcon.</sp>
    <sp n="212"><speaker>SPADE</speaker> I see. </sp>

        I've done I love you.</sp>
    <sp n="253"><speaker>SPADE</speaker> I don't care who loves who. I'm not going to play the sap
        for you. I won't walk in Thursby's and I don't know how many other's footsteps. You killed
        my partner and you're going over for it!</sp>
    <sp n="254"><speaker>BRIGID</speaker> Why must you do this to me Sam?! Surely, your partner
        wasn't as much to you as--!</sp>
    <sp n="255"><speaker>SPADE</speaker> Listen! Listen to me! This won't do any good. You'll never
        understand me but I'll try once and then give it up. Listen. When a man's partner is killed,
        he's supposed to do something about it. And it happens we're in the detective business.
        Well, when one of your organization gets killed, it's - bad business to let the killer get
        away with it. Bad all around. Bad for every detective everywhere.</sp>
    <sp n="256"><speaker>BRIGID</speaker> You can't send me to the--! Sam! You can't! You love me!
        You love me! </sp>
    <sp n="257"><speaker>SPADE</speaker>
        <stage>SIGHS</stage> Maybe I do. What of it? Maybe next month I won't. I've been through it
        before. I'll have some rotten nights after I've sent you over, but that'll pass. I want you,
        sure, but I won't take you at the price because - because all of me wants to, regardless of
        consequences. And because you counted on that with me, the same as you counted on that with
        all the others.</sp>
    <sp n="258"><speaker>BRIGID</speaker> Oh, Sam! Darling ... Kiss me, kiss me.</sp>
    <sp n="259"><speaker>SPADE</speaker> Sure. Sure, baby.</sp>

    <sp n="262"><speaker>ANNOUNCER</speaker> Just as thrilling as tracking down some fabulous
        treasure is the search for the unknown which goes on unceasingly in the Squibb research
        laboratories. For that is the search that leads to the discovery of new life- saving drugs
        and new life-saving uses for existing drugs. And streptomycin is one of the newest products
        of this searching. In the new field of medicine opened up by penicillin, streptomycin, still
        in the testing stages, shows great promise against additional enemies of mankind. That is
        why Squibb scientists are working night and day to unlock the secrets of streptomycin. To
        improve the strain, to find and test all the ways in which it may be used in the conquest of
        disease. It is this same questing spirit, this refusal to stop anywhere short of perfection,
        that inspires all endeavors of the House of Squibb. It is one reason why, wherever you come
        across it in the service of human health, Squibb is a name you can trust!</sp>
